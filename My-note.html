          <h1>The components of Web</h1>
             <b>WWW</b>
               <p>
               	 World wide web is a collection of HTML documents. It is the largest web.
               </p>
             <b>Web</b>
               <p>
              	The major piceces of Web are <em>users, browser, the internet, HTTP, and servers.</em>
                <br>
                In my oppinion, web is a stage allowing files directed by HTML to appear.

             <b>HTML</b>
               <p>
                HTML refers to <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>.It's job is to decide what you can see in web pages.
                <br>
                The components of HTML are <em>Text content, markup, reference to orther document and links to other pages.</em>
                <br>
                <em>Markup</em> maters most. It decides how the web pages look like. 
                <br>
                <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48724340"> This is a explaning video about what is HTML and components of it.</a>
               </p>
            <b>Tags</b>
               <p>
                There are many tags in HTML. They are basic elements of HTML.
                <br>
                Only if you tell web browser the type of the tag of each element the browser can interprets the page as your wish. 
                <br>
                <br>
                That's why the computer are "stupid". 
                <br>
                <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444">The differences between those tags can be well described by this video.</a>
                <br>
               </p>
            <b>Inline vs Block</b>
               <p>
                HTML tags can have different types of either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block tags have space that has width and length while inline tags not.
